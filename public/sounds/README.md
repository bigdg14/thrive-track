## Rest Timer Sound

You need to add a `timer-complete.mp3` file to this directory.

### Options:

1. **Use a free sound from freesound.org**:
   - Visit https://freesound.org
   - Search for "bell" or "chime" or "notification"
   - Download and rename to `timer-complete.mp3`

2. **Generate online**:
   - Visit https://www.beepbox.co/
   - Create a simple beep sound
   - Export as MP3
   - Rename to `timer-complete.mp3`

3. **Use system sound** (temporary):
   - Use any short notification sound
   - Convert to MP3 if needed
   - Place in this directory

4. **Create programmatically** (fallback):
   - The app will work without sound
   - A console log will appear instead
   - Sound can be added later

## File Required

- `timer-complete.mp3` - Plays when rest timer completes
